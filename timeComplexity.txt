Algorithm	                 Time Complexity
Bubble sort                 	O(n^2)
Selection sort	                O(n^2)
Insertion sort	                O(n^2)
Merge sort	                    O(n log n)
Quick sort	                    O(n log n)
Heap sort	                    O(n log n)
Radix sort	                    O(nk), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits in the radix sort


Timsort	                        O(n log n)
Note: The time complexity listed is for the worst-case scenario, and
